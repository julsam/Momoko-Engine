:::TODO:::

* write windowPos to config file when shuting down the app
* write ConfigFile::createDefaultFile
* handling exceptions
* handle the "keeping pressed" input case
* isButtonPressed(), isKeyPressed()
* defineMaskKey("jump", SDLK_x, SDLK_c)
* Color class
* Maybe should I make a PhysicObject class, separated from Entity ?
* later: define some physics material like crate, stone, etc
